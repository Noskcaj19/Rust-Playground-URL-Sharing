# Rust Playground URL Sharing

A userscript to add sharing code in URLs to the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

### Installation

You can run this userscript by installing [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net), a Userscript extension that supports *tons* of browser and probably yours. Just go [here](https://github.com/Noskcaj19/Rust-Playground-URL-Sharing/blob/master/rust_playground.user.js), and either A) Click "raw" and it should prompt you to install it, or B) copy + paste the code into the "Add New Script" area.

If you use Google Chrome, you _may_ be able to install the userscript without Tampermonkey by going to `chrome://extensions` and dragging `rust_playground.user.js` to the list.

For Firefox users, [Greasemonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey) may work also.
